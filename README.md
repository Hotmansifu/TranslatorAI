`Translator AI`

This repository contains a machine learning based natural language translator. The translator uses advanced deep learning algorithms to translate text from one language to another. The application supports multiple languages and is capable of accurately translating even complex sentences.

`Features`
Supports multiple languages
Ability to translate text from one language to another
Accurately translates complex sentences
Simple and easy to use interface
Responsive design that works on all devices
Technical Details
The application uses deep learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to translate the text. The application is built using Python and uses the TensorFlow library for machine learning. The application also uses a pre-trained neural network model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data.

`Usage`
To use the Translator AI, simply enter the text you want to translate in the input field and select the source and target languages. The translated text will be displayed on the page.
